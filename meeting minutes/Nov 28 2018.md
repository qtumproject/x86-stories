# x86 Prototype

## Core work

Some missing functions:

* sha256/sha3 hashing in contracts
* Coin transfer

What works:

* Contract calls/communication
* sendtocontract, balance changes
* Events
* Basic functions/on-par with EVM

Optional things:

* gdb debugging support for contracts
* getstate/getevent for x86 contracts


## Infrastructure work

WIP:

* abigen, code generation tool for using a simple ABI in contracts -- also encodes parameters etc into contract data
-- currently basic code gen for calling contracts, being worked on by a friend of Earlz; written in JS
* Docker container for x86 toolchain and all needed development tools
-- Basic version capable of compiling the toolchain and qtum-x86 complete, but needs helper functions for running and using the container

Optional:

* libqtum-mock -- A version of libqtum that exposes all of the same functions as contracts have, but run on native machine outside of Qtum blockchain. Useful for testing and designing contracts.
*  C++ support — no API

## Documentation

Needed:

* Hello World type tutorial for running an x86 contract
* Standard library, libqtum, documentation for what functions are available in C x86 contracts
* Porting guide -- all information for what is necessary to make a new language work on x86 VM
* Hello World for libqtum-mock



# Help with

* Libqtum-mock — stories / discussion needed
* Docker container — stories
* Standard library documentation — basic version (gitbook?) , then I’ll help + stories
* Abigen —after minimal version —stories
* Getstate/getevent RPC calls — stories
* Web3/qtumjs for x86 —hand off
* Not just x86 — QtumJ/BitcoinJ fork —RPC only -- hand off
